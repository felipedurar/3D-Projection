# 3D-Projection
3D Projection of a Cube rendered by Software

## What is this project?
This project is an application that renders 3D models using just 2D primitive functions. All the geometric transformations used for projection, viewport and models are all calculated in the code itself.

## What's the point of it?
The objective of creating this project is just for self validation of my knoledge on Analytic Geometry and Linear Algebra and test my skills using transformation matrix.

## How does it works?
This code calculates the transformation for a perspective projection, the calculus simulates a Pinhole Camera Model so we basically define the Pinhole Position (The position of the camera), the display surface's position relative to the camera pinhole (like a photographic film on the back of the camera), the orientation of the camera and the point to be projected. 


The first step is to calculate the camera transformation that is basically the dot product of the rotation matrices of the camera orientation by the difference of the projected point to the camera like the picture bellow ("a" is the point to be projected and "c" is the position of the camera):

The next step is to project the transformed point into the 2D Plane calculating the dot product of the matrix bellow that used homogeneous coordinates by the display surface's position ("e"):

And then calculate the point projected into the 2D Plane:

## Calculating the FOV (Field of View)
The Field of View is directly related to the distance of the display surface's position, since the angle of the field can be determined by "radAngle = 2 * arctan(1/Ez)" we can use a reverse operation to calculate the position of the display surface's Z position based on the angle. The operation to determine the Z position of the display surface's Z position is the following:

```
Zposition = -math.tan(1 / ((fovDeg * math.pi) / 180)) * 2
```

The image bellow illustrates the relation between the Field of View and the distance between the image plane from the camera aperture. As it moves farther away the angle of the FOV decreses in the same ratio as described in the formula above.

## Calculating the Depth
Since using a Z-Buffer would not be a good ideia without using the GPU the easiest way so far is to use the Painter's Algorith. So basically everytime we calculate de camera projection transformation (The "d" matrix above) we store the z value that at this point is already relative to the camera, and then for the subsequent frames we sort the order of the faces that should be rendered by the last Z Value, this way we ensure that the faces from behind the cube are rendered first avoid some artifacts.  
Bellow you can see an example of the Painter's Algorithm, basically the most distant elements are rendered before, this way closer elements overlaps the distant ones.

## How to Run It?
This project uses the pygame (for 2D rendering) and numpy (for matrix operations), just install these libraries using pip and then run "python perspective3d.py" to run this project on your computer.
